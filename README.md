# Personal-Projects
Uses Trie structure to find keywords to recommend what data structure should be used to implement a project, also printing out
 complexities of each data structure.
Inspiration: Learned about tries in CS251 at Purdue but didn't get to use them
             I also have wondered since the beginning of my studies how instructors choose what to implement for specifice projects
As I am not too far into my coding career, the only keywords I know are what the definitions are,
 so any real-word keyword recommendations or additional data structures will be appreciated.
